# Traffic-Light-Recognition-System

The project aims to develop an advanced Tra ic Sign Recognition (TSR) system leveraging 
data science and analytics techniques. Tra ic signs play a crucial role in ensuring road 
safety by conveying important information to drivers. However, manual recognition of 
tra ic signs can be prone to errors, leading to potential accidents. By employing machine 
learning algorithms and computer vision techniques, this project seeks to automate the 
process of tra ic sign recognition, thereby enhancing overall road safety. The 
methodology involves collecting a comprehensive dataset of tra ic sign images, 
preprocessing the data, training deep learning models, and evaluating their performance 
on real-world scenarios. The project will also explore the integration of geographical 
information and contextual data to improve the accuracy and reliability of the recognition 
system. The ultimate goal is to develop a robust and e icient TSR system that can 
accurately detect and interpret various types of tra ic signs under diverse environmental 
conditions.
